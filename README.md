# SoupQL: Soup of the Da(-tabase)

SoupQL is a delicious demonstration of in-browser embedded SQL (sql.js) database proficiency. 

In SoupQL, the user will be presented with an interface to select aspects of their favorite soups (Broth-based, Cream-based, Cheese-based, etc) and be served with a list of common soups matching their selection. 

The database will be run through the browser using embedded SQLite library. 

The interface will be run through standard HTML/CSS frontend and will rely on JS to serve the embedded library running the sql.js. 

SoupQL will be updated as additional soups are discovered. Is salsa a soup, for example? Food for thought.
